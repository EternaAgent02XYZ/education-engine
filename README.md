# Education Engine
Secure deployment template for all engines.

## Structure
- `public/index.html` → Main entry point
- `public/style.css` → Styling
- `public/script.js` → Frontend logic

## Deploy Ritual
1. Create `public/index.html` first
2. Add `style.css` + `script.js`
3. Commit + push → auto-sync enabled
4. Manual Deploy → Clear build cache → Redeploy

## Notes
This repo is part of the Eterna Engine sequence. Each engine has its own Gift Hub + Render account for clean scaling.
